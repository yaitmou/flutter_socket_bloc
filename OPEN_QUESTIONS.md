# socket_api.dart
Here im stuck on line [29]. Im not able to retrieve the user data. For demo purposes im providing a hardcoded id [1]
on line [33] in [chat.dart]. On line [34] before it goes to the [socket_api] class i have the data which is not null

what is the difference between a constructor and a factory constructor actually?

# main.dart
line [18]. Is it correct that I always have to pass an instance now? Could you explain me this pattern a little bit more? I also needed to pass it on line [18] in [socket_api.dart]
