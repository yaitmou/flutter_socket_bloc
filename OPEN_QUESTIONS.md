# chat.dart
From line [27] is there a better approach? I first tried to wrap it in initstate but then I always got null on my user object

# what is the difference between a constructor and a factory constructor actually?

# main.dart
line [18]. Is it correct that I always have to pass an instance now? Could you explain me this pattern a little bit more? I also needed to pass it on line [18] in [socket_api.dart]

# PLEASE CHECK THE WHOLE PROJECT
And if you find better approaches please rewrite the code and comment it so I can improve my code understanding and learn more from it
